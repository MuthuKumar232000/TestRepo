# voyaj-load-test

## Introduction

This project built exposes the load testing of Voyaj APIs on JMeter

### Technology Considerations
    1. Programming Language                Java
    2. Version                             apache-jmeter-5.4.1
    3. Build Tool                           JMeter
    
## Introduction to JMeter
 - Apache JMeter is a testing tool used for analyzing and measuring the performance of different software services and products. It is a pure Java open source software used for testing Web Application or FTP application.
It is used to execute performance testing, load testing and functional testing of web applications. JMeter can also simulate a heavy load on a server by creating tons of virtual concurrent users to the web server.

## How does JMeter perform Testing?
 - Let’s have a look at the different steps performed by JMeter during testing:
	1.It creates a request and sends to the server.
	2.It receives the response from servers, collects them and visualizes those details in a chart or graph.
	3.It processes the response from the server.
	4.It generates the test result in several formats such as text, XML, JSON so that the tester can analyze data.
 - Now that you know what is JMeter and how it works, let’s move on and have a look at the prerequisites for installing JMeter.
 - Then, you can create your own test plan in JMeter with the help of different elements.

## Install JMeter
 - The Operating Systems compatible with JMeter are:
	Linux
	Windows
	Mac OS
	Ubuntu
 - Download the Jmeter from https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
 - Once Download the Jmeter files on Systems compatible then simply unzip the zip/tar file into the directory where you want JMeter to be installed. There is no tedious installation screen to deal with.
